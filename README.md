# Welcome! Iâ€™m Austin Shih. Software Engineer | Full Stack
## About Me
I am a 3rd year Computer Science and Statistics double major at UC Davis. I have a passion for both engineering and music, so over the years, a lot of my work has been done to learn skills that can help me solve music related problems.

Additionally, I spend most of my time at Davis creating resources and hosting workshops to teach my team of 25 developers full stack web development skills. Once they're ready, they will help me build out an E-store framework as well as an in-house Content Management System for future clients of our club, #include at Davis.

## Project Overview
Just a quick rundown of my projects.

### IELC - Student Run Tutoring Center Website
My responsibility for this site was to lead a group of beginner web developers in sucessfully delivering this website for the summer tutoring program. Given roughly 15 weeks, me and my co-tech-lead taught these students from the ground up, starting with HTML/CSS/JS and ending with Next.js. Rather than writing the code ourselves, we guided them along the way and reviewed their code as mentors.

### Bloom and Vine - Wedding Services Website
I worked on the backend for this site, using Strapi CMS to allow our client to edit her site with ease. Towards the end, I became a tech lead and took responsibility in ensuring that the site was deployed on time in a reliable manner.
